*This project is currently under development*

BluFi Network is a blockchain infrastructure that is specifically built ideally for the sole purpose of GIVING. With multiple projects on the schedule to be built on BluFi, the main focus is to utilize and avail the PoS (Proof of Stake) mechanism for pool generating and reward distribution. Implementing a fully decentralized system of "shadow nodes" to ensure security and rapid validation. Simple, seamless and efficient for both web3 users and web2 natives. With projects such as a Music Arcade for leisure, to a payment processing system for B2B/B2C/P2P usage to achieve the common goal of cash reward distribution, with just one single click. The unique approach of this blockchain is to practice FULL decentralization and that means to disable the delegation feature of traditional PoS systems, instead the collection of liquidating pools will be open and available to anyone who opens a BluFi wallet account which the cash rewards will be equally distibuted once a month with the goal and hopes to make a difference in the battle against poverty and hunger in any region across the globe. As of now, I am open to accept ANY kind of help and contribution, whether through funding or development participation, to make this possible. To whoever is reading this, I just want to thank you for just taking a moment of interest or curiosity. Many blessings to all ü´±üèΩ‚Äçü´≤üèæ
